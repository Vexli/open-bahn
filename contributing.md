# Contributing to Open Bahn
Looking to contribute to improving Open Bahn, look no further. Read the corresponding section and follow its steps.

## Question?
Got a question about one of the databases or about the Open Bahn project in general?

  - Open an [issue](https://github.com/Vexli/open-bahn/issues) beginning with `[QUESTION]`

## Adding Information
Ready to add some new information to an existing database?

  1. Create a branch of Open Bahn
  2. Create your changes
  3. Commit your changes
  4. Open a pull request

Be sure to include your sources `source.json` in the respective database.

Perfect, just wait for your branch to be reviewed and merged with the `main` branch. Thank you!

## Correcting Information
Found some incorrect or outdated information? If your comfortable, follow the same steps as [Adding Information](#adding-information), otherwise open an [issue]() and make sure to include the following information:

  - What information is incorrect
  - Correct information
  - Source of the correct information

## Suggest a Database
Can't find what you are looking for but think it will make a good addition to the project? Look through the existing [issues](https://github.com/Vexli/open-bahn/issues) to see if your database idea has already been discussed. If not:

  1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/Vexli/open-bahn/issues) beginning with `[IDEA]`
  2. Describe the goal of the proposed database (why it makes sense to include in Open Bahn)
